# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

What it must do:
Create an application that generates a random password based on user-selected criteria. This app will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code. It will also feature a clean and polished user interface and be responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

Description: 
I used a pre made Html and CSS file to make a password generator using JavaScript. You must click Generate password and you will be presented a prompt. You must choose a number between 8-128. Than you will be presented several prompts asking for what type of characters you can shoose to add to your password. If you choose any of these incorrectly you will be sent back to the start. I used ASCII code which was much easier than using all the Arrays. At the end it will prompt you the choices you chose. The user will get a password as an alert than will be sent to the actual HTML webpage.
